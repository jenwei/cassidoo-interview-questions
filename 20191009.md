Given an integer n, write a function to count all possible sequences of length n
such that all the elements of the sequence are in the range [1 to n] and the sum
of the elements of the sequence is even.

Example:
countEvenSequences(3)
> 13

// All possible sequences of length 3 will be (1, 1, 2), (1, 3, 2),
// (3, 1, 2), (3, 3, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 3),
// (2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (2, 3, 3) and (2, 2, 2).
